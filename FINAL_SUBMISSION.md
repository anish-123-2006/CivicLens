## FAQ FOR JUDGES

**Q: Is this production-ready?**
A: For a hackathon MVP, absolutely yes. For production, we'd add: push notifications, PWA offline sync, real government API integration, email verification, rate limiting.

**Q: Why base64 images instead of Firebase Storage?**
A: Smart trade-off for hackathon - avoids Storage billing, simplifies CORS, demonstrates problem-solving. Production: would use Storage + CDN.

**Q: How do you prevent spam/fake reports?**
A: Upvote system is first defense. For production: email verification, duplicate detection, AI verification confidence score, admin manual review.

**Q: Can this scale to a real city?**
A: Yes, fully. Firestore handles millions of documents, Google Maps doesn't have issue limits, Gemini is production-ready. Same codebase works for any city.

**Q: What's your competitive advantage?**
A: Dual-sided platform (citizen + government) + heatmap insights + voice accessibility + social integration = most complete solution in the space.
