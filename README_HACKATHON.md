# 🏆 CivicLens - AI-Powered Civic Issue Reporting Platform

**Submitted for: 13-Day Online Hackathon**

> *Empowering citizens to report civic issues, validate community problems, and hold municipalities accountable through AI-powered analysis and transparent action tracking.*

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Cities face a critical challenge: **civic problems pile up because authorities don't know where to focus resources**. Current systems suffer from:

- ❌ Scattered complaint portals with no verification
- ❌ No prioritization (1 complaint = 100 complaints)
- ❌ Lack of transparency (did anyone actually fix it?)
- ❌ No data insights for urban planning
- ❌ Inaccessible for non-digital citizens

---

## ✨ Our Solution: CivicLens

A **dual-sided civic action platform** that:

1. **Empowers Citizens**: Easy photo-based reporting with AI analysis
2. **Validates Problems**: Community upvotes prove legitimacy
3. **Drives Action**: Public Kanban board shows authorities' progress
4. **Provides Insights**: Heatmap analytics for resource allocation
5. **Closes the Loop**: See issues from report to resolution
